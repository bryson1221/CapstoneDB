# CapstoneDB

The third artifact of my e-Portfolio is a database that consists of PGA stats from the 2022 season. I used DB Browser SQLite as my IDE and retrieved the stats from www.pgatour.com.

# Here is the original work: 

This extensive database comprised over 5,000 records, encompassing numerous statistics that were irrelevant to determining a golfer's success. This database was virtually unreadable due to its overwhelming nature and jumbled information. 

# Here are my improvements: 

I performed CRUD operations to showcase my abilities to perform all necessary actions within a database. 

I created a golfer ‘John Johnson’ and inserted him into the database. 

I read into the database to determine which stats were most relevant to a golfer’s success. 

I updated the database to only show the top 5 performers at each tournament throughout the year. 

I updated the stats of my created golfer to ‘blend in’ with the other top performers. 

I deleted numerous columns that seemed redundant and irrelevant to my intended purpose. 

I also added password encryption that is required before opening the database when transferring a zip file.

# Here is the value of these improvements: 

Inserting a new golfer into the database shows my ability to successfully implement new data. 

Determining which stats are most correlated to a golfer’s success can help identify & predict which golfers may have success in the future. 

Updating the database to the top 5 golfers from each tournament makes it readable and relevant. 

Deleting columns removes a lot of ‘noise’ from the database and focuses on the key stats that should be considered.  

Adding password encryption makes it safer to send zip files from one another.

# Here is how I met the course outcomes:

Course Outcome 1: I employed strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in the field of computer science by completing the following enhancements:

I demonstrated the ability to store and manipulate data within the database by performing CRUD operations. 

I addressed logical flaws in the data by cleaning it and making it readable. This allows anyone to gather insight into what stats are most correlated with a golfer’s success.

Course Outcome 5: I developed a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources by completing the following enhancements:

I implemented a security measure that allows for the database to be transferred as a zip file with password encryption.
